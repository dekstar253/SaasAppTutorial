notes

Ruby Stuff:
    Ruby is the language, Rails is the framework.  A bunch of files that do stuff
    gems - prewritten bits of code from other devs to use in Rails.  Like plugins
    gemset - a list of gems assigned to a particular app.
    bundle install command or bundle update
    gemfile - file with a list of gems and versions
    gemfile.lock - all nested gems and dependencies

Adding Homepage
    Quick and dirty - Go to /public/ and add index.html.  BUT no rails functions just temporary page.  
    Rails Way: 
        3 files work together - controller file, views file, routes file 
        add to app/controllers/pages_controller.rb - ruby file.  Created PagesController class from ApplicationController class. Function called home.  (Method) 
        add to views.  All files in the views folders make up the look of site. Filename home must match method name.  
        need to add page to config/routes.rb Says the root needs to be home method in pages controller. 
        
Adding custome google fonts
    Went to google fonts.  added the link to /views/layouts/application.html.erb and defined h1, h2, h3 in app/assets/stylesheets/application.css

Adding About page
    Used the 3 files.  Created app/layouts/pages/about.html.erb, added controller action and added route. 
    
Using Bootstrap
    Can just get the link from bootstrapcdn.com and paste into the /apps/views/layouts/application.html.erb file, but there's a gem for that!
    gem 'bootstrap-sass', '3.3.7'
    rename /app/stylesheets/application.css to .scss
